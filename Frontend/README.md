# Task Management Contract
This repository contains a Solidity smart contract named Task. The Task contract allows users to manage a list of tasks, with functionality to create, update, mark as completed, retrieve, and delete tasks. The contract is designed to be owned by a single address, ensuring that only the owner can perform certain actions.

## Description
The Task contract provides a decentralized way to manage a task list. Users can create, update, complete, retrieve, and delete tasks. The contract ensures that only the owner can make changes, providing security and control over the task list.

## Getting Started
Installing
No installation is required for this contract. It is intended to be deployed to a blockchain network such as Ethereum.

## Executing Program
Deploying the Contract
Compile the Contract:
Use a Solidity compiler compatible with the specified pragma version (0.8.22) to compile the contract.

## Deploy the Contract:
Deploy the compiled contract to a blockchain network of your choice (e.g., Ethereum mainnet, sepolia, localhost).

## Interacting with the Contract
After deployment, you can interact with the contract using its ABI (Application Binary Interface).

## Frontend
The frontend is created using react and vite. Clone the repo then run these commands:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
``
This will allow you to interact with the task management contract from the frontend.
